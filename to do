What I want from this:
Import data
  Input csv with terms and definitions
  create new topic and save definitions to db

Quizzing
  Call topic
  pull a term, the correct definition and 3 other random definitions
  display output in appealing view
  keep track of correct and incorrect answers
  Possibly:
    chose number of terms to do at once
      (all on one page)
    

flashcards
  call topic
  show term and click to flip to definition
    or vice versa
  button for next term
  
  possibly user accounts for seperate users
